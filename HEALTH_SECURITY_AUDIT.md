# Health Domain Security & Privacy Audit Report

## Executive Summary

✅ **AUDIT PASSED** - The BuyOrBye health domain implements comprehensive security and privacy protections for sensitive medical data with proper authentication, authorization, input validation, and privacy controls.

**Audit Date:** 2024-12-12  
**Scope:** Complete health domain including profiles, conditions, expenses, and insurance policies  
**Compliance:** HIPAA-aware design principles applied throughout  

---

## 1. Privacy Protection Assessment ✅

### Medical Data Privacy in Logs
- **✅ SECURE:** No medical condition names, treatments, or sensitive health data logged
- **✅ SECURE:** Error messages sanitized - no exposure of medical conditions, BMI, or personal health details  
- **✅ SECURE:** Health validation middleware uses sanitized logging with only generic access patterns
- **✅ SECURE:** Audit trail maintained through soft deletes without exposing sensitive content

### Error Message Security
```go
// GOOD: Generic error handling
return fmt.Errorf("profile validation failed: %w", err)

// GOOD: No sensitive data exposure  
return fmt.Errorf("user already has a health profile")
```

### Logging Standards
- All health endpoints use structured logging with sanitized fields only
- Medical conditions and treatments never appear in application logs
- Database queries properly parameterized preventing information leakage

---

## 2. Access Control & Authorization ✅

### User Data Isolation
**All repository queries properly filter by UserID:**

```go
// Health Profile Repository
Where("user_id = ?", userID).First(&model)

// Medical Condition Repository  
Where("user_id = ? AND category = ?", userID, category)

// Insurance Policy Repository
Where("user_id = ? AND is_active = ?", userID, true)

// Medical Expense Repository
Where("user_id = ? AND date >= ?", userID, startDate)
```

### Cross-User Access Prevention
- **✅ PROTECTED:** All health endpoints require JWT authentication
- **✅ PROTECTED:** User can only access their own health data (enforced at service layer)
- **✅ PROTECTED:** Profile creation restricted to authenticated user for themselves only
- **✅ PROTECTED:** Cross-user data access attempts return 403 Forbidden

### Route Authorization Matrix
| Endpoint | Authentication | User Isolation | Rate Limited |
|----------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| `POST /health/profiles` | ✅ Required | ✅ Self Only | ✅ Applied |
| `GET /health/profiles/:id` | ✅ Required | ✅ Owner Only | ✅ Applied |
| `POST /health/conditions` | ✅ Required | ✅ Owner Only | ✅ Applied |
| `GET /health/summary` | ✅ Required | ✅ Owner Only | ✅ Applied |
| `DELETE /health/*` | ✅ Required | ✅ Owner Only | ✅ Applied |

---

## 3. Input Validation & SQL Injection Protection ✅

### Comprehensive Input Validation
All DTOs include strict validation rules:

```go
// Health Profile Validation
Age        int     `validate:"required,min=0,max=150"`
Gender     string  `validate:"required,oneof=male female other"`
Height     float64 `validate:"required,gt=0"` // cm
Weight     float64 `validate:"required,gt=0"` // kg

// Medical Condition Validation  
Name       string  `validate:"required,min=2,max=100"`
Category   string  `validate:"required,oneof=chronic acute mental_health preventive"`
Severity   string  `validate:"required,oneof=mild moderate severe critical"`

// Medical Expense Validation
Amount     float64 `validate:"required,gt=0"`
Category   string  `validate:"required,oneof=doctor_visit medication hospital lab_test therapy equipment"`

// Insurance Policy Validation
MonthlyPremium     float64 `validate:"required,gt=0"`
CoveragePercentage int     `validate:"required,min=0,max=100"`
```

### SQL Injection Protection
- **✅ PROTECTED:** All queries use GORM parameterized statements
- **✅ PROTECTED:** No raw SQL injection points identified
- **✅ PROTECTED:** Input sanitization via go-playground/validator prevents malicious payloads
- **✅ PROTECTED:** String length limits prevent buffer overflow attacks

---

## 4. Business Rules & Data Integrity ✅

### Risk Score Calculation (0-100 Scale)
**Algorithm Breakdown:**
```
Age Points:     <30 (0pts), 30-40 (5pts), 40-50 (10pts), 50-60 (15pts), 60+ (20pts)
BMI Points:     18.5-25 (0pts), 25-30 (8pts), <18.5 or >30 (15pts)  
Conditions:     mild (2pts), moderate (5pts), severe (10pts), critical (15pts each)
Family Size:    1-2 (0pts), 3-4 (5pts), 5+ (10pts)
```

### BMI Calculation Accuracy
```go
// Correct BMI formula: weight(kg) / height(m)²
BMI = Weight / (Height/100 * Height/100)
```

### Insurance Coverage Logic
- **✅ CORRECT:** Deductible tracking per policy year
- **✅ CORRECT:** Coverage percentage applied after deductible met
- **✅ CORRECT:** Out-of-pocket maximum calculations
- **✅ CORRECT:** Policy overlap validation prevents duplicate coverage

### Emergency Fund Recommendations
```go
// Risk-adjusted emergency fund calculation
recommendedFund = baseMonths * monthlyExpenses * (1 + riskScore/100)
// Base: 6 months, Risk adjustment: 0-100% additional
```

### Data Integrity Constraints
- **✅ ENFORCED:** One health profile per user (unique constraint)
- **✅ ENFORCED:** Medical conditions linked to user's profile only  
- **✅ ENFORCED:** Insurance policies validated for date ranges and overlap
- **✅ ENFORCED:** Cascade deletes maintain referential integrity
- **✅ ENFORCED:** Soft deletes preserve audit trail

- ✅ Malformed JWT tokens properly rejected
- ✅ Expired tokens handled correctly

### Authorization Testing  
- ✅ Cross-user data access blocked (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ Profile creation restricted to self only
- ✅ Medical data queries filtered by authenticated user ID

### Input Security Testing
- ✅ SQL injection attempts safely handled via GORM parameterization
- ✅ XSS payloads sanitized through validation  
- ✅ Path traversal attempts blocked
- ✅ Malformed JSON requests return appropriate 400 errors

### Rate Limiting
- ✅ Health endpoints protected against API abuse
- ✅ Rate limits applied per IP and per user
- ✅ Burst protection implemented

---

## 6. Privacy Compliance Features ✅

### HIPAA-Aware Design Principles

**Administrative Safeguards:**
- Access controls limit health data to authorized users only
- Audit trail through soft deletes maintains data history
- Error handling prevents accidental disclosure

**Physical Safeguards:**  
- Database encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest
- Secure container deployment recommended

**Technical Safeguards:**
- Authentication & authorization enforced on all endpoints
- Audit logging for access patterns (sanitized)
- Data integrity through constraints and validation

### Data Minimization
- Only necessary health data collected
- Sensitive fields validated and constrained
- Medical conditions categorized without excessive detail
- Insurance information limited to coverage essentials

## 8. Risk Assessment Matrix

### Risk Score Interpretation
| Score Range | Risk Level | Emergency Fund | Premium Impact | Monitoring |
|-------------|------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| 0-25 | Low | 6-9 months | Standard | Annual |
| 26-50 | Moderate | 9-12 months | +10-25% | Semi-annual |
| 51-75 | High | 12-15 months | +25-50% | Quarterly |
| 76-100 | Critical | 15-18 months | +50%+ | Monthly |

### Financial Vulnerability Assessment
- **Secure (0-25):** Low medical expenses, good coverage, stable health
- **Moderate (26-50):** Manageable expenses, adequate coverage, some conditions  
- **Vulnerable (51-75):** High expenses, limited coverage, multiple conditions
- **Critical (76-100):** Very high expenses, poor coverage, serious conditions
