# ðŸŽ¯ BuyOrBye Finance Domain - Final Audit Report

## âœ… ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE - PASSED

### Layer Separation Verification
- âœ… **No GORM imports in services**: Confirmed clean separation
- âœ… **No DTOs in services**: Domain structs used exclusively  
- âœ… **No business logic in handlers**: Pure HTTP transport layer
- âœ… **No business logic in repositories**: CRUD operations only

### Data Flow Compliance
```
âœ… Middleware â†’ Validation â†’ Handler â†’ Service â†’ Repository â†’ Database
âœ… DTO â†’ Domain â†’ Model (proper conversions at each boundary)
```

### Dependency Injection
```go
âœ… DB â†’ Repositories â†’ Services â†’ Handlers â†’ Routes
âœ… Clean interface definitions with proper abstraction
âœ… No circular dependencies detected
```

---

## âœ… BUSINESS RULES IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE

### âœ… Frequency Normalization
**Implementation**: `internal/domain/income.go`, `internal/domain/expense.go`, `internal/middleware/finance_validation.go`
- Daily â†’ Monthly: `amount Ã— 30`
- Weekly â†’ Monthly: `amount Ã— 4.33`
- Monthly â†’ Monthly: `amount Ã— 1`
- One-time â†’ Monthly: `0` (excluded from recurring calculations)

**Middleware Integration**: Automatic normalization in `NormalizeFrequency()` middleware

### âœ… DTI Ratio Calculation
**Implementation**: `internal/domain/finance_summary.go`, `internal/services/finance_service.go`
```go
DTI = Monthly Loan Payments / Monthly Income

Thresholds:
- Excellent: â‰¤ 28%
- Healthy: â‰¤ 36% 
- Concerning: 36-50%
- Poor: > 50%
```

### âœ… Financial Health Scoring
**Implementation**: `internal/domain/finance_summary.go`
```go
Algorithm Factors:
1. DTI Ratio (primary weight)
2. Savings Rate (secondary weight)  
3. Disposable Income (tertiary weight)
4. Overspending check (negative disposable income = Poor)

Health Levels: Excellent â†’ Good â†’ Fair â†’ Poor
```

### âœ… Savings Rate Calculation  
**Implementation**: `internal/domain/finance_summary.go`
```go
Savings Rate = (Monthly Income - Monthly Expenses - Monthly Loans) / Monthly Income

Targets:
- Excellent: â‰¥ 20%
- Good: 15-19%
- Fair: 10-14%
- Poor: < 10%
```

### âœ… Purchase Affordability
**Implementation**: `internal/domain/finance_summary.go`
```go
Dynamic Multipliers based on Financial Health:
- Excellent: 3.5x disposable income
- Good: 3.0x disposable income
- Fair: 2.0x disposable income  
- Poor: 0.5x disposable income

Risk-based recommendations included
```

## âœ… SECURITY AUDIT - COMPREHENSIVE

### âœ… Authentication Requirements
**Implementation**: All finance routes protected
```go
// All finance endpoints require JWT authentication
financeGroup.Use(middleware.JWTAuth(fr.jwtService))

// Protected routes verified:
- POST /finance/income âœ…
- GET /finance/income âœ… 
- PUT /finance/income/:id âœ…
- DELETE /finance/income/:id âœ…
- All expense endpoints âœ…
- All loan endpoints âœ…
- All analysis endpoints âœ…
```

### âœ… User Data Isolation
**Implementation**: `internal/middleware/finance_validation.go`
```go
// Ownership validation middleware
ValidateUserOwnership() - Ensures users only access own records
- UPDATE operations: Verify ownership before allowing changes
- DELETE operations: Verify ownership before allowing deletion  
- GET operations: Filter by authenticated user ID
- 403 Forbidden returned for cross-user access attempts
```

### âœ… Input Validation
**Implementation**: `internal/middleware/finance_validation.go`
```go
ValidateFinancialData() middleware:
- Amount fields: Must be positive (> 0)
- Required fields: Non-empty validation
- Data types: Strict type checking
- JSON format: Malformed payload rejection
- Request size: 1MB limit enforcement
```

### âœ… Positive Amount Validation
**Implementation**: Multi-layer validation
```go
1. Middleware Layer: ValidateFinancialData()
   - Rejects negative amounts before handler processing
   
2. Domain Layer: Validate() methods
   - Business rule enforcement in domain structs
   
3. Service Layer: Additional validation
   - Service-level business logic validation
```
